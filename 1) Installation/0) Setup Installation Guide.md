## Step 1 - Setting up Enviroments
### Anaconda

You can use your own python interpreter or environment manager, I put Anaconda here as I find it easy and it's the one I used.

- Download the correct Anaconda version for your computer from here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

- Install it as per your needs and set up your environment - good guide: https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-python-environments-using-conda-32e9f2779307

### Find the SDS
- Open a web browser and navigate to: https://github.com/SDS-Architect/Synthetic_Data_System 


### Getting the clone link

### Using the clone link and terminal/command prompt
- Navigate back to the terminal window you opened with Git

- Type in (no quotes!): 'git clone' plus the link you copied from the 'clone or download' button then hit enter

- This will download the code and files needed and create a folder called 'Synthetic_Data_System'

## Step 3 - Install Synthetic Data System
In the current folder (1) Installation and Parameters) select the instructions for your computer:
- If you are using a Linux based computer open - Installation Guide for Linux.md
- If you are using a Windows based computer open - Installation Guide for Windows.md
